ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Ryan.

I'm a software engineer with 10+ years experience in ~~muddling through~~ developing applications and websites. Most of those years I've spent doing C# & .NET, which I'm pretty passionate about (still!).

I'm most interested in Application Development (Desktop and Mobile) and DevOps, but in the last decade I've had the pleasure (or pain, depending...) of working with:

* .NET / C# / VB.NET
* HoloLens (Oooh. ðŸŒŸ)
* Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)
* Universal Windows Platform (UWP)
* WinForms (Ahh! ðŸ˜±)
* Xamarin
* Azure Services (incl. App Services and Functions)
* AWS (incl. Elastic Beanstalk & Lambdas)
* ASP.NET MVC / WebAPI (Framework and Core)
* TypeScript / JavaScript / React and Friends
* Android (Java)
* iOS (Objective-C/C++)
* Powershell / Bash
* TFS/VSO/VSTS/ADOS

I'd like to think with a deep knowledge on the _very_ eclectic mix above that I might have a few things worth sharing with the community. So here goes!
